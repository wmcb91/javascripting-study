# JavaScript: `javascripting` Review

**This study should be completed over multiple evenings.**

[nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/) is an excellent free and open-source
resource for learning Node. We will use nodeschool in the future to help us
learn back-end web development using node. For now, we'll use the
[javascripting](https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting) workshop to review
what we've learned so far.

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Recognize common, fundamental development patterns in JavaScript.
-   Work with primitives, reference types, control flow, callbacks, and array
    methods.

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
1.  Change into the new directory.
1.  Create and checkout a new branch, named `response`.
